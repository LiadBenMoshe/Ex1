Our main goal in this project is to emplements complex functions. 
We take monom and polynom, turn them in to function and print them on a graph. In addittion we can take function from a .txt
file and the oppeset.

In our project we have several a callses:

Monom: Calculate the actions plus, minus, multipy, divide and f(x). equal bettween 2 monoms.

Plynom: Collection of monoms. Made the same actions like the monom. also we have function call root- Intermediate value theorem 
and function call area- calcuate the area bettween the function and the positive area.

complexFunction:Calculate the actions plus, mul,divide, min, max and comp -f(g(x)).

Function_GUI: Collection of function- drow the function in coordinate system. read, write and print funnction from files and to files.
